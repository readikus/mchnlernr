<p>In 2007, I received a PhD in using machine learning to improve speech synthesis at the University of East Anglia, sponsored by Nuance Communications. Currently consulting as a software engineer for some of the biggest enterprise brands in the world.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not programming, I spend time with my wife and our dogs, mountain biking or trying to grow fruit and vegetables.</p>
